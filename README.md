This Model details the development of a machine learning model for predicting the
prices of second-hand cars, utilizing a dataset generated from key vehicle
features. The dataset includes variables such as manufacturer, model, year of
purchase, fuel type, and mileage. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we
examined the relationships among these features, identifying significant patterns and
trends that influence car pricing. A linear regression model was chosen for its
simplicity and effectiveness in predicting continuous outcomes. The model was
evaluated using the R2 score, achieving a commendable accuracy of 0.84.
Furthermore, the report describes the integration of the machine learning model with
a static HTML website, developed using Flask, which allows users to input car
details and receive price predictions in real-time. This project aims to provide
potential buyers with valuable insights, facilitating informed decision-making in the
second-hand car market.
